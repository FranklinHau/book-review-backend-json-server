# Book Review App Backend

This is the backend for the Book Review App. It uses a simple JSON file as a database to store information about books and their reviews.

## Database Structure

The database is a JSON file named db.json that contains an array of books. Each book is an object with the following properties:

- title: The title of the book.
- author: The author of the book.
- year: The year the book was published (as a number).
- description: A description of the book.
- reviews: An array of reviews for the book. Each review is an object with a text property for the review text and a rating property for the review rating (as a number between 1 and 5).
- id: A unique identifier for the book.

Here is an example of what the db.json file might look like:

```
{
  "books": [
    {
      "title": "The Teachings of Don Juan",
      "author": "Carlos Castaneda",
      "year": "1985",
      "description": "A story of a remarkable journey: the first awesome steps on the road to becoming a 'man of knowledge'",
      "reviews": [
        {
          "text": "\"Extraordinary in every sense of the word.\" â€• The New York Times",
          "rating": 5
        },
        {
          "text": "Must read to understand the path of a warrior -Franklin",
          "rating": 4
        },
        {
          "text": "It sucks!! --theNegativeFamily",
          "rating": 4
        }
      ],
      "id": 1
    },
    ...
  ]
}

```
## Usage

To use the backend, you can make HTTP requests to the server. The server uses the following routes:

- GET /books: Returns an array of all books.
- GET /books/:id: Returns the book with the specified ID.
- POST /books: Adds a new book. The body of the request should be a JSON object representing the book.
- PUT /books/:id: Updates the book with the specified ID. The body of the request should be a JSON object representing the updated book.
- DELETE /books/:id: Deletes the book with the specified ID.

Each book object should have a title, author, year, description, and reviews property. The reviews property should be an array of review objects, and each review object should have a text and rating property.
